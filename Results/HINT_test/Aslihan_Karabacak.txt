DIAGNOSE: Chromosome borders

Hi,

I'm PhD student from Uwe Ohler's lab. First of all thank you for clear installation and usage instructions provided for the HINT code. I'm trying to run the tool on a Drosophila dataset. I think I set up the related dm3 folder correctly under the data folder, because when I run HINT on a subset of the bam file (containing only one chromosome), it works and returns the footprint bed file. However when I try to run it on the complete bam, with all chromosomes included, I get the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/data/ohler/Asli/programs/HINT-1.1.1/bin/rgt-hint", line 9, in <module>
    load_entry_point('RGT==1.1.1', 'console_scripts', 'rgt-hint')()
  File "/data/ohler/Asli/programs/HINT-1.1.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/RGT-1.1.1-py2.7.egg/rgt/HINT/Main.py", line 427, in main
    if(posterior_list[curr_index] == fp_state_nb):
IndexError: index 14158 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 14158

Looks like there is an index out of bounds problem, but I don't understand why this is happening. Have you ever come across this and would you have a possible solution? Any ideas would be appreciated.

Best,
Asli

PS. I'm running HINT in the following way:

rgt-hint --organism dm3 --estimate-bias-correction combined_input_matrix.txt
